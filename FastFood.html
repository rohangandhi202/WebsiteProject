        <h1>My Favorite Restaurants</h1>
        <p>Taco Bell News: Taco Bell started putting the finishing touches on their new streamlined menu in order to make room for new innovations. Theyâ€™re also dedicated to creating a faster and more seamless restaurant experience than ever before, which means evolving their menu, their restaurant designs, and their operations to better serve both their guests and team members alike. They will be adding the Chicken Chipotle Melt, Dragonfruit Frees, Green Sauce, and Quesalupa to their menu and getting rid of the Mexican Pizza, Pico De Gallo salsa, and Shredded Chicken on November 5th of 2020. </p>
        <p>My Usual Order: Most of the time, I order a five dollar Taco Bell box. In my opinion, this is the greatest deal at Taco Bell because you get so much food and a drink for only five dollars. For the past couple months the box was a nacho chicken box, which has been one of my favorites. For my drink I always get a Mountain Dew Baja Blast because I can not get the anywhere else. Last week, Taco Bell added a new five dollar box: the Grande Stacker Box. It comes with two crunchy tacos, a grande stacker, and a Medium Drink. I am excited to try this soon.</p>
        <p>Wendy's News: Wendy's posted an image to Twitter on Monday, stating that the number of retweets the tweet gets will dictate the size of the upcoming discount, with the possibility of that discount swelling to 99% off. If the tweet hits 100 retweets = diners get 10% off. 5,000 retweets = 30% off. 44,444 retweets = 44% off. 3,306,3017 retweets (which is confusing) = 99% off. That last level appears to be a reference to Carter Wilkerson's tweet when he asked for free Wendy's chicken nuggets for life. The tweet, at that time, was the most retweeted tweet of all time. However, the number as written is actually about 33 million with commas in the wrong spot. Though, when someone pointed that out, Wendy's said, "take a number off the back and we'll count it lol." Looks like that might have been a typo. </p>
        <p>My Usual Order: Whenever I go to Wendy's I order a four for four most of the time. In the four for four I get a spicy chicken sandwich, fries, and a four count of spicy nuggets. For my drink I usually get a Doctor Pepper or a Lemonade. My favorite Wendy's sauces for dipping are the sriracha sauce, barbeque sauce, and ketchup. In addition, I have a keychain that allows me to get one free junior chocolate frosty whenever I order anything.</p>
