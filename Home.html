            <p>My name is Rohan Gandhi. I am 17 years old and I am a senior at Bartlett High School in Bartlett, Illinois. This website is a project for AP Computer Science Principles course. This is our first project of the year, and I am using html and css to design my website.</p>

            <p>I made this website with the theme of what would be useful to me as I take on Distance Learning through this pandemic. As a result, the first page I created has my zoom links and daily schedule to make it easy to access my classes and know which zoom calls I need to attend. The second page I made was created to help me track the colleges that I am applying to this year as a senior. The multiple tables and links helps me to keep track of my college application process. For my last three pictures I decided to mix it up and make it fun. For my favorite restaurants I included my two most eaten at fast food places: Wendy's and Taco Bell. This page is just in case I get hungry and I want to look at their menu to see if they have any good deals going on. For my fifth page I included information about my favorite sport: basketball. I made a standings of all the teams and the current playoff bracket with some news of what is going on in the National Basketball Association. My final page is a collection of pictures with my friends to remind me that everything will go back to normal once the pandemic is over and their is a vaccine released. I hope you enjoy my website!</p>
