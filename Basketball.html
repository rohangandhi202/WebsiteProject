        <p>NBA Finals News: Resuming four months later, players, coaches and staffers lived in a bubble, sequestered from the outside world. All games among 22 teams were played at Walt Disney World in Florida. It was an experiment that some believed would never work. It did. As the final game of the season concluded Sunday night, no coronavirus cases inside the bubble were reported. Closing the NBA's socially distanced season, the Los Angeles Lakers won 106-93 over the Miami Heat Sunday in Game 6, taking the league championship. LeBron James had a promise to keep. And he did: Lakers' forward led Los Angeles to their 17th championship, ending a 10-year drought. The 35-year-old superstar became the only player in NBA history to be named MVP in league finals while playing for three teams. He averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game during the finals. The Lakers showcased relentless defense and reached a 30-point lead during the matchup. And it all happened in a protective bubble.</p>
        <p>NBA Power Rankings for Next Season: The Los Angeles Lakers are the 2020 NBA champions, blitzing through the bubble playoffs with a 16-5 record and finishing off the Miami Heat in six games in the NBA Finals. Now what? As the league enters an offseason of more uncertainty, we're taking a way-too-early look at where all 30 teams stand heading into the 2020-21 season.
